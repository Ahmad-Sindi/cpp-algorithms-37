Algorithm Challenge #37 – Sum Until -99
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge requires the user to keep entering numbers.
The program sums all input values until the user enters -99, which stops the process and prints the final total.
This is a common introductory exercise for practicing loops and sentinel values.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
Using while loops in C++

Reading continuous input with cin

Handling sentinel-controlled loops

Updating cumulative sums

Writing clean, predictable control flow

🧩 Example
-
Input:
10
5
3
-99

Output:
Total Sum: 18

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: sum_until_minus_99.cpp

Challenge Number: #37

💬 Notes
-
This exercise strengthens your understanding of repetition structures and input processing in C++.
It's an essential foundation before moving on to more complex loop-driven algorithms.
